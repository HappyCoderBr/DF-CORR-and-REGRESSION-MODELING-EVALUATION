# DF CORR and REGRESSION MODELING EVALUATION

This repository contains Python scripts for conducting correlation analysis and regression modeling evaluation using pandas DataFrames (`DF`). The scripts include functions for calculating correlations between variables in a DataFrame and evaluating various regression models for predictive analysis.

## Features:

- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between variables in a DataFrame using the `corr()` function.
- **Regression Modeling Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of regression models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (`MSE`) and R-squared (`R2`).

## Key Components:

- `correlation_and_regression.py`: Python script for performing correlation analysis and regression modeling evaluation.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Additional script for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- `visualization.py`: Script for visualizing data and model results using matplotlib and seaborn.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python scripts using your preferred IDE or command line interface.
4. Customize the scripts to analyze your own datasets and modify the models as needed.
