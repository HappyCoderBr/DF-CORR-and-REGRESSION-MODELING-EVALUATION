# DF.CORR() and REGRESSION MODELING EVALUATION

This repository contains a Python script for **automatically** conducting correlation analysis and regression modeling evaluation using pandas DataFrames (`DF`). The scripts include functions for calculating correlations between variables in a DataFrame and evaluating various regression models for predictive analysis.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Set FILE_PATH.**
2. **Go to the end of the code to select "df.columns".**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between variables in a DataFrame using the `corr()` function.
- **Regression Modeling Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of regression models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (`MSE`) and R-squared (`R2`).
- **Easy to use output lists:** Provides meaningful insights of data correlations and an easy-to-iterate list.

## üìÇ Key Components

- `correlations_and_regression_widgets.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the previous module + widget to adjust the degree of polynomial regression model + charts.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file with libraries needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
2. **Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.**
3. **Run the Python script using your preferred IDE or command line interface.**
4. **Customize the scripts to analyze your own datasets and modify the models as needed.**
   - In the `correlation_and_regression.py`, go to LINE 24 and the LAST LINE for more information.

## ‚ùì FAQs

- **Multiple Linear Regression:** In the `correlations_and_regression_widgets.ipynb`, when it's displayed as <em>Multiple Linear Regression</em>, it means that there's a list of predictor variables, but you can set just one predictor variable. In this case, it's a <em>Simple Linear Regression</em> displayed as <em>Multiple Linear Regression</em>.
